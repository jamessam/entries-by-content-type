# Entries by content type

The idea behind this script is rather simple. It computes how many entries there are of a particular content type in a Contentful space and prints out this data to your local terminal. Example output:

`article , Article , 4`

## Warnings

This is a very basic, fragile script. It does what it does, but it's by no means robust or full-proof.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Environment variables of SPACE_ID, ENVIRONMENT_ID, MGNT (your CMA personal access token) exported to your local environment.
